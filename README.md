As part of the _Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence_ offered by Imperial College London, a capstone project defining a real-world problem must be completed as a final assessed component of the programme. In my cohort, it was the **Black-Box Optimisation (BBO)** project. The goal of this project was to maximise eight unknown black-box functions $f(\mathbf{x})=y$. These black-box functions
